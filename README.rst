A Python version of the flexibility model to quantify and price the household flexibility options.


Description
===========

As the penetration of the reneweble energy gets higher, it becomes more difficult to stabilize the power grid. Besides the power grid expansion, using industry flexibility and battery storage there are also some other solutions like household flexibility, which can be aggregated for balancing the grid power and traded in the platform. For that purpose one tool is needed to quantify and price the household flexibility in a short time because the constrains of the day-ahead-flexibility market. This script will offer a simple but sufficent algorithem to achieve this goal.  


Note
====

Several household devices have been considered here including: PV, battery, heat pump, combined heat and power
