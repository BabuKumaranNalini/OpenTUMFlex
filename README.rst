An open-source Python based flexibility model to quantify and price the household device flexibility.


Description
===========

With the increasing share of renewable energy, alternative methods are ought to provide power system ancillary services to ensure stable operation of the electricity grids. Recent research have inclined their interests towards the aggregation of the small-scale system flexibility potentials to accommodate the grid variations. The advancements towards local flexibility markets (LFMs) allow prosumers participation in the solving grid congestion problems. In order to allow prosumers to interact with the LFMs and submit their bids, a flexibility estimation is required. This research proposes an open-source flexibility estimation model that quantifies all possible flexibilities from the available prosumer devices.

Device Flexibility
===========
PV, battery, Electric Vehicle (EV), Heat Pump, Combined Heat and Power (CHP)


Input file formats
===========
OpenTUMflex accepts two different file formats (.xlsx/.csv) as input. An example input file is available inside the folder test->data. CSV files reduces the overall optimization time. THe model converts Excel file into CSV files for future use.  

License
===========
OpenTUMFlex can be used to optimize and calculate a households flexibility potential and price it.
